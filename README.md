# Purfect for IDLE
Tested on Python 3.7.0 and IDLE 3.7.0.

The Purfect theme is inspired by the Atom Material Theme and centres around dark-based coding environment. Coding can sometimes be stressful and may cause eye strain when debugging. Thus, dark themes are preferred to light ones because they are less striking and retains the programmer's focus.

The recommended font for Purfect is [Source Code Pro by Adobe](http://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/). This font is recommended since IDLE has no font smoothing. If you don't like Source Code Pro, [Consolas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/typography/font-list/consolas) works too.

## Instructions

 1. Close IDLE if it is running.
 2. Go to %userprofile%\\.idlerc\ and append the config-highlight.cfg file's contents with config-highlight.cfg in this repository. If you don't have one, then just copy the config-highlight.cfg file in this repository to .idlerc.
	> Note that you can edit config-highlight.cfg with any text editor you have, such as Notepad, Notepad++, etc.
3. Start IDLE and go to Options > Configure IDLE > Highlights.
4. In the Highlighting Theme frame, select "a Custom Theme"
5. Select your desired theme from the now-enabled combo-box.
